# Pelmot Creativity — Project Context

Architecture portfolio site for **Pelmot Creativity** (real person behind it: Abdurrazzak Jazmati, "Junior Architect", based in Gaziantep, Turkey). Built as a React SPA, content is managed through Sanity CMS (no code needed to edit content), deployed to Cloudflare Workers. Fully trilingual (English/Turkish/Arabic) with RTL support.

## Live URLs

- **Live site**: https://pelmot-creativity.com (also responds on https://www.pelmot-creativity.com and the legacy https://pelcre.myworkss.workers.dev)
- **Content editor (Sanity Studio)**: https://pelmot-creativity.sanity.studio/ (project ID `cmdikf3a`, unchanged by the ownership transfer below)
- **GitHub repo**: https://github.com/Pelmot/pelcre (branch `main`)
- **Web3Forms dashboard** (contact form submissions): https://web3forms.com — signed up with pelmot.creativity@gmail.com
- **Cloudflare Web Analytics**: Cloudflare dashboard → Analytics & Logs → Web Analytics (under the `pelmot.creativity@gmail.com` account — see Cloudflare account note below)

## Account ownership — fully migrated off the developer's personal accounts (2026-07-13)

Everything this project depends on now lives under Pelmot's own accounts, not the original developer's (`tala.wj@gmail.com` / GitHub `reiw9`):

- **Cloudflare**: Worker + `pelmot-creativity.com` domain deploy under `pelmot.creativity@gmail.com`'s account (ID `1e8a536df4e8ff6fbf2d1306f3b128c4`). `wrangler.jsonc` pins `account_id` explicitly so `wrangler deploy` always targets the right account regardless of which account the local CLI happens to be logged into. The domain was bought directly through Cloudflare Registrar under this account, so its DNS zone was already there — no nameserver migration was needed, just `wrangler deploy` with `routes` (`custom_domain: true`) for the apex and `www` in `wrangler.jsonc`. The old account's Worker (`pelcre.myworkss.workers.dev`, under the developer's personal `reiw` account) is not deleted but now serves **only** a bare 301 redirect to `pelmot-creativity.com` (see the standalone redirect script pattern in git history/session notes if it ever needs recreating — it's a tiny separate `wrangler.jsonc`/script, not part of this repo, deployed directly to that one Worker).
- **Cloudflare Web Analytics**: switched from a manual beacon script (tied to the old account/domain, since removed from `index.html`) to **automatic edge injection** — enabled per-hostname in the new account's dashboard, no code involved.
- **GitHub**: repo transferred from `reiw9/pelcre` to `Pelmot/pelcre`. Old URL still resolves via GitHub's redirect but the local remote and this doc point at the canonical new one.
- **Sanity**: project (`cmdikf3a`) transferred out of the `reiw9`-owned organization into a new organization owned by Pelmot. Project ID/dataset/Studio URL are all unchanged — only org-level ownership/billing moved. The developer's Sanity MCP access no longer sees this project at all post-transfer, confirming full separation; any future Sanity admin work (schema deploys, CORS origins, etc.) needs to go through an account with access to Pelmot's org.
- Cloudflare Turnstile (bot protection for the contact form) had been deferred pending exactly this account move — it can now be set up for real under the new Cloudflare account if wanted.

## Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript (strict) + Vite 8 + Tailwind CSS v4 + Framer Motion + React Router
- i18next + react-i18next for translation (see Internationalization section below)
- Content: Sanity CMS (project ID `cmdikf3a`, dataset `production`) — see `src/lib/sanity.ts` and `src/context/DataContext.tsx`
- Deploy: Cloudflare Workers with static assets (`wrangler.jsonc`, worker name `pelcre`)
- Fonts self-hosted via `@fontsource` (Cormorant Garamond serif + Inter sans), no external font requests

## Internationalization (i18n)

Site supports **English (default), Turkish, Arabic** — auto-detected from the visitor's browser/phone locale (`navigator.language`) on first visit, remembered afterward in localStorage (`pelmot-creativity-language`). A globe icon in the navbar (`LanguageSwitcher.tsx`) lets visitors switch manually at any time. Arabic gets full RTL layout mirroring, not just right-aligned text.

- `src/context/LanguageContext.tsx` — `LanguageProvider`/`useLanguage()`, sets `document.documentElement.lang` and `dir` (`rtl` for Arabic), mirrors the `ThemeContext` pattern
- `src/i18n/index.ts` — i18next init + language auto-detection logic; `src/i18n/locales/{en,tr,ar}.ts` — dictionaries for all static UI strings (nav, buttons, forms, error messages, page headings, etc.), consumed via `useTranslation()` / `t()` in every component
- **RTL implementation**: Tailwind logical properties (`ps-`/`pe-`, `start-`/`end-`, `text-start`/`text-end`) and `rtl:` variants used instead of physical `left`/`right`/`pl`/`pr` throughout; directional icons (arrows, chevrons) get `rtl:rotate-180`. `dir="rtl"` on `<html>` makes Tailwind's built-in `rtl:` variant system apply automatically.
- **CMS content translation**: translatable Sanity fields use reusable `localeString`/`localeText` object schema types holding `{ en, tr, ar }` instead of plain strings. `src/context/DataContext.tsx` fetches the raw multi-language documents *once*, then `pickLocale(field, lang)` resolves the active language via a `useMemo` keyed on `language` — switching languages re-derives data instantly with no refetch.
  - **Localized** (translated): `siteSettings.title`, `.tagline`, `.location`, `.bioParagraphs`, `.philosophy[].title/.text`, `.timeline[].title/.description`, `.skills[].name`, `.software[].category`, `.awards[].title`, `.services[].title/.description/.points[]`, `.testimonials[].role/.quote`, `.pageContent.{home,about,services,projects,contact}.*` (see Data architecture section); `project.excerpt`, `.description`, `.challenge`, `.solution`, `.materials[].name/.detail`
  - **Not localized** (kept as plain strings — proper nouns / brand names by convention): architect `name`, `email`, `phone`, `address`; `project.title`, `.location`, `.client`, `.area`; `timeline[].place`; `awards[].organization`; `software[].name`; `testimonials[].name`; `status` enum (canonical values used for filtering/matching — its *display* label is translated via the `status.*` i18n dictionary keys instead, not by localizing the Sanity field itself). `project.category` used to work the same way but is now a `projectCategory` reference with its own `localeString` name — see Data architecture section.
- **Translation quality**: all existing Turkish/Arabic content was machine-translated by Claude in one pass as a first draft (per user's explicit choice — draft now, refine later). Recommend a native speaker review before treating it as final professional copy, especially since this is a client-facing business site.
- To add a new translatable Sanity field later: add it as `localeString`/`localeText` in the schema (via `deploy_schema`), redeploy Studio (`deploy_studio`), then `pickLocale()` it in `DataContext.tsx`.

## Data architecture

All content (projects, bio, services, timeline, skills, software, awards, testimonials, contact info) lives in Sanity, **not** in local files. `src/data/content.ts` and `src/data/projects.ts` were deleted — don't recreate them as the source of truth.

- `src/lib/sanity.ts` — Sanity client, image URL builder, paragraph-splitting helper, placeholder image for projects with no photo yet
- `src/context/DataContext.tsx` — fetches everything once on app load (`DataProvider`), exposes `useSiteData()` hook returning `{ architect, heroImages, pageContent, sectionOrder, homeFeaturedProjects, bio, timeline, skills, software, awards, services, testimonials, projects }` already resolved to the active language. Shows a full-screen loading state until the fetch resolves.
- Sanity schema has two document types: `project` (repeatable) and `siteSettings` (**singleton — only one should ever exist**, don't create a second one), plus two shared object types `localeString`/`localeText` used for translatable fields (see Internationalization section)
- Images map through `imageUrl()` which returns a neutral Soft-Stone placeholder SVG data-URI if no photo has been uploaded yet — this is intentional, not a bug. Gallery/Floor Plans/Renders sections on the project detail page hide themselves entirely when empty.
- `siteSettings` has two separate photo fields — **Founder Photo** (About page portrait) and **Studio Photo** (Home page "About preview" section) — intentionally independent so the owner can use two different photos.
- **Page hero images**: `siteSettings.{home,about,projects,services,contact}HeroImage` — one banner photo per page, editable from Studio. Mapped in `DataContext.tsx` to `SiteData.heroImages.{home,about,projects,services,contact}`; each page component does `heroImages.X || <hardcoded Unsplash fallback constant in that page file>` so an empty field just keeps the current stock photo instead of breaking. (Project detail pages already had this via `project.coverImage` — unrelated to this field group.)
- **Page titles & section headings**: `siteSettings.pageContent.{home,about,services,projects,contact}.*` — an editable-from-Studio override for every visible heading/eyebrow/short description on those five pages (nav links, buttons, and form labels were deliberately left as plain i18n strings, not moved here). Fields are `localeString`/`localeText` so they're per-language like everything else in Internationalization. Mapped in `DataContext.tsx` to `SiteData.pageContent`; each page component does `pageContent.<page>.<field> || t("<page>.<key>")` — the i18n dictionary value is the fallback/default shown until the site owner overrides it in Studio. When adding a new heading to a page, add the i18n key as usual *and* add a matching field under `pageContent.<page>` in the schema + `DataContext.tsx` + the `PageContent` types in `src/data/types.ts` if it should be owner-editable.
- **Page sections (add/remove/reorder from Studio)**: `siteSettings.sectionOrder.{home,about,services,contact}` — each is a Sanity array of typed "marker" blocks (e.g. `aboutAwardsSection`, `homeTestimonialsSection`) with a single `readOnly` `title` field (used only so Studio shows a readable label in the array list — no other content lives on these objects). The array's order and presence is the entire feature: Studio's native "Add item" / drag-handle / trash-icon controls on that array let the owner reorder, remove, or re-add any optional section — e.g. delete the Awards item to hide Awards from the live About page. Block types carry no real data; the actual content still comes from the existing `awards`/`timeline`/`skills`/etc. arrays — the block is just a placement marker. Hero banners and one "core" content block per page (the Projects grid, the Contact form, the Services list) are intentionally **not** included in any array since removing them would break the page's purpose. `DataContext.tsx`'s `pickSections()` maps `_type` values to `SiteData.sectionOrder.<page>` (a plain `string[]` of type names); each page component renders that array through a `switch` and falls back to a hardcoded default order (matching current layout) only when the field is `null`/`undefined` — an explicit empty array is respected as "show nothing," which is what makes deletion actually work. **Projects page has no removable sections** (hero + project grid are both core to the page's purpose) so it's not part of this system. To add a new optional section type: declare a new marker object type + add it to the relevant `sectionOrder.<page>` array's `of` list in the schema, add the type name to the matching `*_SECTION_TYPES`/`DEFAULT_*_SECTIONS` constants in `DataContext.tsx` and the section-type union in `src/data/types.ts`, then add a `case` in that page's render switch.
- **Home page featured projects (picked & ordered from Studio)**: `siteSettings.homeFeaturedProjects` — an array of references to `project` documents, editable in Studio via the native reference-array UI (add/remove/drag-to-reorder). `DataContext.tsx`'s `SETTINGS_QUERY` dereferences it (`homeFeaturedProjects[]->{...same fields as PROJECTS_QUERY...}`, factored into the shared `PROJECT_FIELDS` GROQ fragment) and maps each through the same `mapProject()` used for the main projects list, dropping any broken/unpublished references (`doc && doc.slug` filter). Exposed as `SiteData.homeFeaturedProjects` — the full ordered list, **not** pre-truncated. `Home.tsx` applies the actual display cap itself via `HOME_FEATURED_PROJECTS_COUNT = 3` (`homeFeaturedProjects.slice(0, HOME_FEATURED_PROJECTS_COUNT)`), so the owner can keep extra projects queued in the array (as backups) beyond what's currently shown — reordering which ones sit in the first 3 slots is how they control what's live. This replaced the old `project.featured` boolean + implicit year-desc sort; the `featured` field/type still exists on `project` (harmless, unused) but no longer drives Home's project list.
- **Project categories (owner-managed taxonomy)**: `project.category` is a `reference` to a `projectCategory` document (own document type, fields: `name` as `localeString`, `order` as `number`) instead of a fixed 5-value string enum — the owner can rename, add, remove, or reorder categories entirely from Studio (create/delete `Project Category` documents, edit `order` to control filter-pill position) with no code changes. `DataContext.tsx`'s `CATEGORIES_QUERY` (`*[_type == "projectCategory"] | order(order asc)`) feeds `SiteData.categories: Category[]` (`{id, name}`, `id` = the category document's `_id`, `name` already localized). `Project.category` holds that same `id` (for filtering/matching, mirroring the old canonical-enum convention) and `Project.categoryName` holds the pre-resolved localized label (mirrors every other already-resolved `Project` field). `ProjectFilter`/`Projects.tsx`/`Footer.tsx` all render from the live `categories` list rather than a hardcoded array — deleting a category document removes its filter pill and footer link automatically; projects still referencing a deleted category just won't match any filter (no crash, `mapProject` falls back to `""`/empty category if the reference is broken). The old `categories.*` i18n dictionary keys (`en/tr/ar.ts`) still exist but are no longer used anywhere in the app (the contact form's "Project type" field that used them was removed) — safe to delete if ever cleaning up, just not done yet.
- **Per-page SEO (title/description, editable from Studio)**: `siteSettings.pageContent.<page>.seoTitle`/`.seoDescription` (added to the same five `pageContent` groups as the headings) feed each page's `<SEO title=... description=...>` call, with the i18n `<page>.seoTitle`/`.seoDescription` value as the fallback — identical pattern to every other `pageContent` field. `src/components/ui/SEO.tsx` (via `react-helmet-async`) sets `<title>`, meta description, canonical URL, and full OG/Twitter Card tags per route. **About/Services/Projects/Contact now also pass `image={heroImages.X || FALLBACK}` to `<SEO>`** (previously only Home did — the others silently fell back to `SEO.tsx`'s generic `DEFAULT_OG_IMAGE`, not their actual hero photo).
- **`index.html` has no page-specific static SEO tags** — `<meta name="description">`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, and the duplicate `twitter:card` were removed from the static `<head>` on 2026-07-10. They used to hardcode Home's copy, and because `react-helmet-async` *appends* its per-page tags rather than replacing pre-existing static ones, every non-Home route ended up with two `<meta name="description">`/`og:image` elements in the DOM — the stale Home-hardcoded one always first, so anything reading "the" meta tag (most OG scrapers, `document.querySelector`) silently got Home's data regardless of which page was actually being shared/crawled. `index.html` now only keeps genuinely page-independent tags (`<title>` as a pre-hydration fallback — safe because `document.title` is a single overwritable property, not a duplicable element — plus charset/viewport/theme-color/favicon/author/og:type/color-scheme). **If you ever add a new site-wide meta tag, add it to `SEO.tsx` (so every route gets it), not to `index.html`'s static `<head>`** — anything page-specific added there will silently shadow the real per-page value the same way.
- CORS is configured on the Sanity project for `http://localhost:5173` (dev), `https://pelmot-creativity.com` and `https://www.pelmot-creativity.com` (prod), plus the legacy `https://pelcre.myworkss.workers.dev` (kept in case that old Worker is still reachable — see Cloudflare account note above). If the site moves to a new domain again, add it via the Sanity MCP `add_cors_origin` tool or sanity.io/manage.

**Current gap**: real project gallery/floor-plan/render photos still need uploading by the site owner through Sanity Studio (Founder Photo and Studio Photo have been wired up and may already be uploaded — check before assuming they're still placeholders).

## Contact form

`src/components/contact/ContactForm.tsx` posts directly to the Web3Forms API (`https://api.web3forms.com/submit`) — no backend code needed. The access key is a hardcoded constant in that file; this is intentional and safe, not a leaked secret — Web3Forms access keys are designed to be public/client-embedded (same as how Web3Forms' own docs show it in plain HTML). Submissions currently deliver to whatever email was used to generate that key (confirm with the site owner which inbox — it was set up understanding it might need to move to the business inbox later; regenerating the key and swapping the constant is a one-line change). On failure, the form shows an inline error with a `mailto:`/`tel:` fallback to the architect's contact info instead of a silent/fake success state.

## Privacy policy

`/privacy` (`src/pages/Privacy.tsx`) is a static, plain-i18n page (not Sanity-backed — deliberately simple boilerplate, not something the owner needs to edit often) covering: contact form data collected, Web3Forms as the processor, Cloudflare Web Analytics being cookie-free, localStorage usage for language/theme preference, and the Google Maps embed on the Contact page. Linked from the Footer's bottom bar next to the copyright line. Content lives in the `privacy.*` i18n keys (`en/tr/ar.ts`) — edit those directly (no CMS) if the wording ever needs to change. Not legal advice; if requirements get more specific (GDPR/KVKK formal compliance), revisit with a real policy.

## SEO & discoverability

- `/sitemap.xml` is generated dynamically at request time by `src/worker.ts` (the Worker's `fetch` handler intercepts that one path before falling through to static assets) — it queries Sanity live for project slugs on each request, edge-cached for 1 hour (`Cache-Control: s-maxage=3600`). No build step or static file involved (the old `scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs` build-time approach was replaced by this — don't recreate it). `STATIC_ROUTES` in `worker.ts` is the hardcoded list of non-project pages included — **add a new page's path there** whenever a new top-level route is added, or it won't show up in the sitemap.
- `src/components/ui/SEO.tsx` sets canonical URL, `og:url`, and full Twitter Card tags per page (in addition to title/description/og:image), computed from the current route via `useLocation()`.

## Analytics

Cloudflare Web Analytics is enabled via **automatic injection** at the edge (Cloudflare dashboard → new account → Analytics & Logs → Web Analytics → the site's "automatic setup" toggle, scoped to a hostname filter for `pelmot-creativity.com`/`www.pelmot-creativity.com`) rather than a manual JS snippet — since the domain's DNS is fully proxied through Cloudflare, Cloudflare injects the RUM beacon into HTML responses itself, no code involved. `index.html` used to hardcode a manual `<script data-cf-beacon>` tag with a token tied to the *old* Cloudflare account/domain; that was removed on 2026-07-13 as part of the account migration (see Cloudflare account section above) since it's both stale and redundant now. Free, cookie-free, view stats in the Cloudflare dashboard under Analytics & Logs → Web Analytics.

## Contact page map

`src/components/contact/StudioMap.tsx` embeds a real interactive Google Map (via the key-free `https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m3!2m1!1s<address>!6i15` URL format — no API key, no billing) rather than a static illustration. Has a subtle dark-mode tint overlay (`pointer-events-none` div) since Google's embed iframe itself can't be recolored.

## Design system

Strict 5-color palette (do not introduce other colors without being asked):

| Token (Tailwind) | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `paper` / `bone` | `#F3F1EC` | Primary background, light-mode default |
| `linen` | `#E0DFD2` | Secondary sections / card backgrounds |
| `mist` | `#B6B8AB` | Borders, dividers, subtle UI |
| `gold` / `gold-soft` | `#9FA3AD` / `#B6B8AB` | Accent (replaces old "gold" naming — token names are legacy, values are the cool-slate/sage palette) |
| `ink` / `charcoal` | `#3C3E4A` | Primary text, nav, buttons, dark-mode background |
| `stone` | derived `color-mix` of ink+paper | Muted body text (kept darker than raw `#9FA3AD` for WCAG AA contrast — this was a deliberate fix, don't lighten it) |

Tokens defined in `src/index.css` `@theme` block. Design rules in effect: no gradients (flat `bg-ink/N` overlays on hero photos instead), no glassmorphism (no `backdrop-blur`, solid opaque surfaces), subtle `rounded-lg` (~8px) on cards/buttons/inputs/images, thin `border-mist` over shadows, dark mode fully supported (class-based, toggle in navbar, localStorage key `pelmot-creativity-theme`). Directional Tailwind utilities should be logical (`ps-`/`pe-`/`start-`/`end-`) rather than physical (`pl-`/`pr-`/`left-`/`right-`) so RTL (Arabic) keeps working — see Internationalization section.

## Contact info (as seeded in Sanity `siteSettings`)

- Email: pelmot.creativity@gmail.com · Phone: 0530 449 94 00
- Address: Ibrahimli Mah. Sehitkamil, Gaziantep, Turkey
- Social: Instagram, LinkedIn (abdurrazzak-jazmati), Behance (abdurrajazmati), X — all real links, already wired into Footer + Contact page + `SocialIcons.tsx` (custom-drawn icons; lucide-react's current version has no brand icons)

## Deploy workflow — standing instruction

**Always commit + push to GitHub and redeploy to Cloudflare after finishing a round of edits, without being asked.** (User preference, stated explicitly.)

```bash
npm run build      # generates sitemap.xml + type-check + vite build
npm run deploy      # build + wrangler deploy (redeploys pelmot-creativity.com — account_id is pinned in wrangler.jsonc)
git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push origin main
```

Sanity content changes (via Studio) go live instantly on their own — no rebuild/redeploy needed for content edits, only for actual code changes. **Exception**: schema changes (`deploy_schema`) need a Studio redeploy (`deploy_studio`) to show correctly in the editing UI, and if a field's *type* changes (e.g. plain string → `localeString`), existing documents need their data migrated/patched to the new shape too — changing the schema alone does not transform already-stored data (Sanity is schemaless underneath; the schema only governs Studio's form UI).

## Known environment quirks (not app bugs)

- The Claude Code preview tool (`preview_screenshot`) sometimes hangs or shows stale/wrong-tab state after several calls in one session — stopping and restarting the preview server (`preview_stop` then `preview_start`) reliably fixes it. Don't chase this as a real rendering bug.
- Custom viewport sizes via `preview_resize` occasionally render only in a corner of the screenshot; using presets (`desktop`/`mobile`/`tablet`) avoids it.
- `git push` to GitHub has occasionally failed once with a connection timeout then succeeded on immediate retry — treat a single failure as transient before investigating further. The same has been observed for Sanity's API/CDN (`apicdn.sanity.io`) — if a fetch times out, check `google.com`/`github.com` too before assuming a code bug; if only some external hosts fail, it's a local network blip, not the app.
- `preview_click`'s coordinate-based clicking can be unreliable on elements inside the fixed header/nav, especially right after a viewport resize or on ambiguous selectors that match both a desktop and mobile variant of the same element (e.g. two buttons sharing one `aria-label`, only one visible at a time). If a click seems to have no effect, verify with a direct `element.click()` via `preview_eval` on a freshly-queried, confirmed-visible element before concluding something is broken.

## Reference: full walkthrough for the site owner

A step-by-step non-technical content-editing guide was published as a Claude Artifact (log into Studio, edit/add projects, upload photos, edit site-wide info, invite a collaborator). It predates the i18n work and doesn't cover the new per-language field tabs — if regenerated, mention that translatable fields now show English/Turkish/Arabic inputs. The schema itself lives only in Sanity (deployed via the Sanity MCP `deploy_schema`/`get_schema` tools), not in this repo.
