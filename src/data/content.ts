    question: "What is the typical process for a new residential commission?",

      "Every project begins with a site visit and a series of conversations to understand how you actually want to live, followed by concept design, design development, construction documentation, and construction administration. Most residential projects take 8–14 months from first meeting to permit-ready drawings, and 12–24 months to build.",

  {
    question: "What is your fee structure?",
